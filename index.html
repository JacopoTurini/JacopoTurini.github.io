<h2>Jacopo Turini</h2> 
	<p align="justify">I am a researcher in cognitive science and psychology, currently waiting to defend my PhD at the Goethe University of Frankfurt.
	My research has investigated the interplay of visual perception, semantic memory and language comprehension, with particular focus 
        on how humans learn and use the structure of the environment to efficiently recognize, search and interact with objects.</p>

        <p align="justify">To do so, I have primarly designed behavioural experiments (online and offline) and analyzed data using Generalized Linear Mixed-effects Models (GLMMs);
        I have also experienced collection and analysis of Magneto-/Electroencephalography (M/EEG) data, as well as employment of machine learning algorithms
        for classification, prediction and clustering.</p>

        <p align="justify">Before working on my PhD at the Scene Grammar Lab of Melissa Vo, I have done a research internship with Daniel Kaiser and Radek Cichy at the Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition group of the Free University of Berlin, 
        I have obtained my master's degree at the Center for Mind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC) of University of Trento supervised by Roberto Bottini and Oliver Collignon, and I earned
        my bachelor's degree from the Department of Psychology of University of Milano-Bicocca.</p>

        <p align="justify">Bridging between knowledge from psychological sciences and skills from data analysis, I am interested in working with data to understand human behaviour, in individuals and groups, 
        to design solutions in products, services and policies. Besides, using the experience gained doing research, I am interested in supporting and developing scientific projects outside academia.</p>
